The backend API currently serves as a gateway for IPFS content and this will become more distributed when more nodes join Pedity. Fees, Content and contracts Content Fees Content fees is divided in two parts. 1. Storing IPFS hash on blockchain Pedity stores IPFS hash in stellar blockchain in memo field and manage data fields. Each operation cost minimum fees on stellar operation. The base fee (currently 100 stroops) is used in transaction fees. The base reserve (currently 0.5 XLM) is used in minimum account balances. (# of operations \u00d7 base fee) Reference Stellar Fees 2. Storing data using IPFS Pedity stores data on nodes using IPFS, each node is paid minimum PEDI fees and the fees is distributed to every node that stores this data. Currently minimum fees is 10 PEDI for any content which can be changed in future since data size may vary for video, images and text based content. Refer nodes.md for more information Speed Speed is an important factor in Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT), every content on Pedity is a transaction and hence transaction time determines when an article is available on Stellar. Stellar transaction time is approximately around ~5 seconds. Reference Stellar Transactions Smart Contracts Pedity has various types of rewards on the platform but subscriptions are processed based on smart contract. Once a reader/user subscribes to the author, the transactions are processed based on smart contract. By Alpha 0.5, even the goals will be based on smart contract so that an author can raise funds for a particular goal and if authors fails to achieve those goals, the funds will be released back to all contributers. Refer rewards.md for more information Key Storage In Alpha 0.1.x i.e. testnet, private keys were stored in browser storage. While this improves usability, it is preferred to never store private keys. Your private keys will never be stored at any node as well. For Alpha 0.2, you will have to use your private key for every operation. Since anyone can be a node on Pedity and key security is most important, we are working on making this a much better experience in future Pedity release. Stellar Pedity uses Stellar network through Horizon (RESTFUL HTTP API Server), which is basically built on stellar core that is maintained by various individuals and organizations. The main backbone of Pedity is Stellar Network and we interact with Horizon for all operations. Read more about Stellar NOTE: Pedity is also planning to be a stellar node for better operations in future. IPFS Storing content related data on blockchain is possible but not preferred. Instead we use IPFS to store that data, IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. Read more on IPFS Since there is no reward for storing IPFS data for users, we reward each node to store Pedity content in a unique manner using PEDI. Read nodes.md for information on storage of content. IPFS is still in active development and so is Pedity, make sure to read CHANGELOG on github to stay updated about every release. PEDI Nodes There are two type of nodes on Pedity, Active and Dormant nodes. Key difference in both node is that Active node are server specific and Dormant Node re user specific. Active Node Need server space Stores all content on PEDI ecosystem Can have their own website/niche Can create their own community of users Gain PEDI rewards for storing content Dormant Node User specific nodes Stores own content Do not gain PEDI rewards General These are general concepts on Pedity where your XLM/PEDI address of Stellar Network becomes your identity. Content Your content on pedity.com (or any other node) will be like Pedity.com/article/73.......dc4062defb01 As you might have guessed, the 73....dc4062defb01 is the transaction id. Every transaction id can be viewed as a content if they are using valid IPFS data. An example of article :- On Pedity Alpha 0.1.x testnet :- Profile Your profile on pedity.com (or any other node) will be like Pedity.com/profile/G....ADDRESS All the data of this profile is stored in IPFS which is distributed to different peers using PEDI.

Hence your data on one node can easily be viewed on another node. There are two type of nodes on Pedity, Active and Dormant nodes. Key difference in both node is that Active node are server specific and Dormant Node are user specific. Dormant Node Dormat nodes are user specific nodes, it is similar to how to setup IPFS on a computer. When you use PEDI desktop application, you are connected to PEDI network as a dormant node and you can make local edits to your data on PEDI desktop application. Once it is published on Stellar, it gets distributed from your dormant node to an active node and hence get's distributed among complete swarm. The benefit of being a dormant node is that a user will always have a local backup of their content on their system. Dormat nodes can also store other PEDI content but it is not required and they don't get PEDI rewards. Pedity Desktop application is planned by Alpha 0.4 and is work in progress. Active Node Active nodes are similar to websites where a webmaster needs to host their website on a server. Similarly, an active node is managed on a server and can be connected to a frontend community (Refer Community.md for more details). That server can be joined by any user and the node start gaining PEDI in two ways - By getting fee of every content that is created on the network By getting revenue shared by other PEDI nodes Home Node Active node that hosts website and collects the fees directly from user is a home node Away Node Every node is an away node when it is referenced from a Home node. Fee and Revenue Fee to a user creating content is revenue to the nodes that are storing content. Fee - revenue is divided in one-to-many approach where fees division follows the one-to-many algorithm described below. Suppose X is fees and N is the number of node in PEDI network Fee = X PEDI X PEDI = X/2 + X/N + X/N + .... N times X/N Home Node revenue = X/2 PEDI Away Node revenue = X/N PEDI The Home node gets 50% of the revenue for it's user because the home node drives the traffic on it's network. Similarly every node will be Home for their's network. This way, it allows distribution of offchain content using IPFS and the power of PEDI tokens. Setting up a node is extremely simple, you need to edit the config.toml and download the latest version of PEDI nodes suite from Pedity Github.

Type of Rewards Tips Tips are the fastest way to reward content creator. On Pedity, reader can use XLM, PEDI and any other stellar asset to instantly support their favorite content creator. Tips have been tested from Alpha 0.1.x and are available for both publishers and verfied publishers. Subscriptions Subscriptions are unique, once a viewer subscribes to a content creator a fixed amount of PEDI will be sent to every creator they have subscribed and will be donated to the creater by the end of month. The reward duration will always be fixed and the amount is reduced based on a fix pool of amount you wish to subscribe. This will be available in Alpha 0.4 and are available for both publishers and verfied publishers. Goal Rewards Goals is a unique way for content creators to share their fundraiser campaigns. In Alpha 0.1.x, user can use PEDI and XLM to contribute to fundraiser. By Alpha 0.5, the goals will be based on smart contract so that content creator can raise funds for a particular goal and if authors fails to achieve those goals, the funds will be released back to all contributers. Goals have been tested from Alpha 0.1.x and are available for both publishers and verfied publishers. Recurring Rewards Recurring Rewards is the only benefit available to Verified contributors. Once a user becomes Verified contributor, they get recurring amount of rewards every month for their contributions. All information on this will be available by Alpha 0.3 Node Rewards Node rewards are rewarded and shared between nodes for storing content. Refer nodes.md for information on this.
